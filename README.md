This is the repository for Samuel Berg√©'s bachelor's thesis in 2025.

The project deals with polygon aggregation. We want to aggregate polygons (f.e. buildings in a street map) such that
the orientation of the edges is preserved as much as possible. 




While this repository contains the code that was written for this project, for comparison with the delaunay triangulation
in the bachelorsthesis, we used code provided internal by Rottmann et al. (as referenced in the thesis).
